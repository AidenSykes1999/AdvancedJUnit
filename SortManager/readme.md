<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](Screenshot_1.png)


This Project was developed and committed to over the span of a week. Night 4 and Day 5 of the Project experienced technical difficulties
due to the workstation involved having issues. Commits otherwise are consistent and accurately depict workflow.

This project intends to implement Bubble Sort, Merge Sort and Binary Tree Searching via the MVC structure. It will also allow users to select which searches they desire and allow them to compare performance times.

* <h3>Controller</h3>

The Controller will take your request and parse it into one of the available requests. At the moment this program supports 'Merge', 'Bubble' and 'Binary' commands as well as the option to 'Quit' the program.

Provided you enter a correct option, the program will then perform the appropriate function. For more information, please see the [Model] section.


* <h3>View</h3>

The View section of the project will provide you with updates and results. These updates include validation failures. For example, if you select a wrong choice the view will communicate with you.

This is accomplished by comparing your input to a catalogue of commands stored within the View.
