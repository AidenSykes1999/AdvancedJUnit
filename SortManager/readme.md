<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](Screenshot_1.png)


This Project was developed and committed to over the span of a week. Night 4 and Day 5 of the Project experienced technical difficulties
due to the workstation involved having issues. Commits otherwise are consistent and accurately depict workflow.

This project intends to implement Bubble Sort, Merge Sort and Binary Tree Searching via the MVC structure. It will also allow users to select which searches they desire and allow them to compare performance times.
